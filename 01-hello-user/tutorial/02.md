Hello User Tutorial: Step 2
===========================

The hello handler we built in [step 1](01.md) looks a bit cluttered. One main issue is that the handler has hard dependency to the database instance. It will be hard if we need to share the database with other handlers, or want to change the database driver in production. What we need is to do the database instantiation outside the handler and pass it in through `config`:

```javascript
var helloHandlerBuilder = function(config, callback) {
  var db = config.database

  var handler = function(args, callback) {
    var userId = args.user_id

    db.findOne({ user_id: userId }, function(err, user) {
      if(err) return callback(err)
      if(!user) return callback(error(404, 'user not found'))

      var greeting = 'hello, ' + user.name
      callback(null, greeting)
    })
  }

  callback(null, handler)
}
```

A naiive way to load a database into config is to construct the database manually during config loading. But we have a better way to handle that dependency by using [middleware](https://github.com/quiverjs/doc/blob/master/core/06-middleware.md).

```javascript
var mockDatabaseMiddleware = function(config, handlerBuilder, callback) {
  var db = new Nedb()

  db.insert(mockUserEntries, function(err) {
    if(err) return callback(err)

    config.database = db
    handlerBuilder(config, callback)
  })
}
```

For tutorial simplicity, a new in-memory NeDB is created for each middleware instantiation. The middleware then insert the created database into `config` and pass it on to the main handler, which in this case would be our hello handler.

We then link the middleware dependency to the handler:

```javascript
var quiverComponents = [
  {
    name: 'demo hello handler',
    type: 'simple handler',
    inputType: 'void',
    outputType: 'text',
    middlewares: [
      'demo mock database middleware'
    ],
    handlerBuilder: helloHandlerBuilder
  },
  {
    name: 'demo mock database middleware',
    type: 'handleable middleware',
    middleware: mockDatabaseMiddleware
  } 
]
```

With that we are now able to reuse the database middleware with any handler that need database access. When migrating to production all we then have to do is to rewrite the middleware to connect to a production database server with different database driver.
