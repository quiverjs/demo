Introduction
------------

Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown
allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text
format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

Thus, "Markdown" is two things: (1) a plain text formatting syntax;
and (2) a software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text
formatting to HTML. See the [Syntax][] page for details pertaining to
Markdown's formatting syntax. You can try it out, right now, using the
online [Dingus][].

The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is to make
it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted
document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking
like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While
Markdown's syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML
filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown's
syntax is the format of plain text email.

The best way to get a feel for Markdown's formatting syntax is simply
to look at a Markdown-formatted document. For example, you can view
the Markdown source for the article text on this page here:
<http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/index.text>

(You can use this '.text' suffix trick to view the Markdown source for
the content of each of the pages in this section, e.g. the
[Syntax][s_src] and [License][l_src] pages.)

  [s_src]: /projects/markdown/syntax.text
  [l_src]: /projects/markdown/license.text

Markdown is free software, available under a BSD-style open source
license. See the [License] [pl] page for more information.
